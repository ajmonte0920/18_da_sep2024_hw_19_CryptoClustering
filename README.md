# 19_da_sep2024_hw_19_CryptoClustering
HW 19 (unsupervised learning) for Data Science Bootcamp


# In this challenge I used python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 


# This code clusters different crypotocurrencies based on similarities in their data. First, the data is cleaned and scaled. Then, the code uses K-Means to find patterns and cluster the cryptocurrencies. The data is then simplified and visualized through the use of PCA and TNSE. Lastly, the code tests how well the clusters are formed and visualizes them using scatter plots.
